# Test Cases (Lab)

This folder documents how the rules in `rules/local.rules` were validated in a controlled lab.

## Status
Lab re-build in progress. Test evidence (sanitized alert snippets + screenshots) will be added after rerunning the lab on Ubuntu 20.04.

## Planned validations
- Port scan / recon spike (Nmap)
- SQLi indicator strings against a lab HTTP service
- SSH connection spike heuristic
- SYN/ICMP flood heuristic (isolated lab only)
